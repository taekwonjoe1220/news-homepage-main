## Overview

  Thanks for checking out this README! I used this frontendmentor.io challenge to play with the bootstrap framework and learn about how to integrate utility classes into my CSS. I did not fully complete the challenge as it was intended, but I plan to go back and update a few things with custom CSS as well as a bit of JavaScript to finalize this project. Feel free to leave any feedback!

## My process
I started with building out the semantic tags for the HTML such as the header, nav, main, sections, and footer. I then added the bootstrap framework via link tags in the head. My next task was to build the layout using bootstraps grid system of rows & columns while keeping in mind a mobile-first development process. It took me some time to wrap my head around utilizing the columns to make this possible, but once I got the hang of it bootstrap was very easy to work with.

Once I got the core layout complete for each section, I worked on updating the different components with custom CSS properties to better meet the needs of the design (color scheme, active states, etc.). With those things in place, I decided to utilize the bootstrap features for the collapsable navbar instead of creating my own. I will later update this to better meet the needs of the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework


### What I learned

Like I said before, this was a chance for me to learn more about utilizing the bootstrap framework for quickly putting a layout together using utility classes for my CSS. I learned quite a bit about the grid layout bootsrap uses with the rows and columns method. Making the site responsive for mobile and desktop was incredibly easy to do using the mobile-first approach of bootstrap.
